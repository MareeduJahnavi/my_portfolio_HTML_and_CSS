        <strong>Hi,</strong><br><br>
        My name is Jahnavi<br><br>
        I born in and brought up in Nidumolu<br><br>
        I have completed my engineering in Dhanekula Institute of Engineering & Technology in the stream of Computer Science and Engineering<br><br>
        As I am a CS student, I am passionated to learn new things apart from Academics so I joined in Java Full Stack in Tap Academy<br><br>
        I have a good patience, I can easily adapt to any environment and if I decided to do anything I will complete it<br><br>
        I usually like to spend time with my family<br><br>
        Moving on to my family details, we are a family of four, my father is a farmer and my mother is a housewife and a elder sister<br><br>
        Thanks for the time.<span>&#128522;</span>
