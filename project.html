    <h2 id="h2">Role in Project: System Design and Implementation</h2>

    <p id="p1">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music is an integral part of our lives. Users are exposed solely to mainstream music. 
        Selecting the most important features is a very crucial task for systems like facial expression
        recognition.The proposed system is an emotion-based recommendation system that helps the
        users to listento music. Thegoal is to classify each facial image into one of the seven facial
        emotion categories consideredsuch as angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise and neutral. To 
        classify the emotion, first the object should be detected from an inputted image.</big>

            The Haar-Cascades algorithm is used to detect the object from the image. This algorithm can be defined in
            different stages: Calculating Haar Features, Creating Integral Images, BiLSTM, Implementing
            Cascading Classifiers. BiLSTM (Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory) a deep learning 
            model is used to classify the emotion of a human. Based on the predicted emotion the music is 
            mapped and playlist is recommended to the user. k-means clustering algorithm is used to map the music to 
            the predicted emotion. As compared to the existing models the deep learning model BiLSTM will give 
            better accuracy and the best performance.

    <h1 id="h3"><q>Welcome To My Portfolio</q></h1>
    <p id="p3">
        <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portfolio's serve the purpose of an extensive record of a studentâ€™s best work and skills.
            A resume can't give complete details about the skills and the work. So, I decided to design my portfolio
            using HTML. In this project I have designed five web pages namely ABOUT ME, EDUCATION DETAILS, PROJECT, 
            CERTIFICATION, CONTACT ME. I have linked that five web pages to another web page. And I have deployed the project.
